On my night time, I have been redesigning and redeveloping my personal website with new front end technologies now that I have better understanding about [`npm` ](https://www.npmjs.com) and other front end tools. In this new website, I introduced two new sections. 

1. Blog
2. Snippets

This year, I have decided to start writing blogs on my personal site and also added some things to learn before end of this year.

- `Vue.js`
- `Electron` (Build any small useful application)
- Write `blogs` on my site
- Create small snippets collections on my site

## Purpose

Main purpose was to build something using latest JS frameworks. I started learning React but then felt too much to invest time and was looking for any other new frameworks that provide same if no more features and functionalities. I ended up on `Vue.js`. I started to feel like this is something I can easily learn and put it into work. I built my new blog using `Nuxt.js` and hosting is using `Netlify` which I believe gives really nice and easy workflow to manage your personal static websites.

I wanted to create a place where I can write blogs about some new tools/technologies/frameworks anything that I learn but also I can post some code snippets and can come back to it when needed.

## Blogs
As mentioned earlier, I am planning to write some blogs this year on my personal site. Being front end developer, I chose to create static site instead of using any content management system.

In progess...
